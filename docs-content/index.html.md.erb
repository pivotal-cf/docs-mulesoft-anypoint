This documentation describes the Mulesoft Anypoint Platform Service Brokers tile for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF). For instructions on how to install and configure it, see [Installing and Configuring Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/mulesoft/installing.html).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

[Anypoint Platform](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/enterprise-integration) solves the most challenging connectivity problems across SOA, SaaS, and APIs. It's a unified, highly productive, hybrid integration platform that creates a seamless application network of apps, data and devices with API-led connectivity.

The Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF connect applications running on PCF to the Anypoint Platform. The tile includes two service brokers, the **Runtime Manager Service Broker** and the **API Gateway Manager Service Broker**. The Anypoint Platform for PCF, which includes the two service brokers of the Anypoint Platform On-Premises Edition, enables organizations to design, develop, deploy, manage and operate APIs, connectivity apps and microservices within PCF.

## <a id="features"></a> Key Features

* Integrates PCF with Anypoint's [Runtime Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/) to track and manage Mule apps deployed to PCF.

* Mediates between PCF and the Anypoint [API Manager](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/) to track and manage registered APIs.

* Includes [Anypoint Exchange](https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-fundamentals/v/3.8/anypoint-exchange), where your organization can discover and share assets for use and reuse throughout your integrations.

### <a id="rmsb"></a> Runtime Manager Service Broker

The **Runtime Manager Service Broker** exposes PCF as a deployment target within the Anypoint Runtime Manager and lets you deploy Mule applications to PCF, alongside other deployment targets. See [Deployment Strategies](https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies) for example scenarios where Mule apps deploy to cloud or local-environment targets.

### <a id="apigsb"></a> API Gateway Manager Service Broker

The API Gateway Manager lets you create and deploy a Mule API proxy that intercepts traffic to a non-Mule app running on PCF. This lets you use the Mulesoft interface to apply policies over the API and the PCF interface to view usage and policy metrics. See [Deploy a Proxy](https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/setting-up-an-api-proxy).


### <a id='sb'></a> What is a Service Broker?

A Service Broker allows Cloud Foundry applications to bind to services and interact with them easily from the UI or the command line. The **Anypoint Platform Service Brokers for PCF** tile lets PCF apps use one or more Anypoint Platform accounts. The tile deploys as a Java app on PCF and exposes the Anypoint Runtime Manager and Anypoint API Manager as brokered services on the Cloud Foundry Marketplace. PCF developers can then create instances of these services and bind them to their applications either from the Pivotal Apps Manager Console or from the command line. This simplifies the installation and  use of the Anypoint Platform with PCF apps.
